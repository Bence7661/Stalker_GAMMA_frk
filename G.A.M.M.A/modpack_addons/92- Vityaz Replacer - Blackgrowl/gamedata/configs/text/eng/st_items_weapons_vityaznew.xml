	<string id="st_wpn_vityaznew_descr">
		<text>A 9x19mm Parabellum submachine gun developed from the PP-19 Bizon, made in 2004 by Russian small arms manufacturer Izhmash. Based on the AK-74 and even sharing most of its parts, it is considered to be the "MP5 of the Russian Federation", and rightfully so, since it's used by the Spetsnaz units of the Interior Ministry, the Federal Security Service and the Federal Guard Service. This is the "SN" variant, which means it has a railed dust cover but no dove-tail side rail, meaning it can use NATO scopes but no Warsaw Pact scopes. \n \n
