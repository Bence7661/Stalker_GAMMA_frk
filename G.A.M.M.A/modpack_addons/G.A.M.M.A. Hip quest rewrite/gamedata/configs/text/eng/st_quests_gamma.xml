		<text>Dear stalker, I have a mission for you if you are up to the task. My assistants and research teams need to check some anomalies in the Lab X16, also called the Brain Lab, or the Miracle Machine. According to recent researchs, such laboratories can apparently encompass very rare artefacts. The main issue is that ever since the machine has been turned off, the lab has become the new home of many mutants. This hinders my research and I need the Lab X16 to be purged from the mutants presence. Could you help me?</text>

		<text>Dear stalker, I have a mission for you if you are up to the task. My assistants and research teams need to check some anomalies in Agroprom Underground. According to recent researchs, this place contains rare artefacts. However this installation is full of mutants and is very unsecure. If my research teams know it has been recently cleaned by an experienced stalker, I think they will have enough courage to perform some research in these underground tunnels. Could you help me?</text>
