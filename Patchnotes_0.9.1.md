- Cr3pis textures and icons fixes to GAMMA Large Files

- New set of MCM values for the newly added addons.


**Progression**
- Stashes changes and new toolkits spawn logic:
    - Changed map tiers and stash content code.
    - Green stashes are now the main source of tools.
    - White stashes have a very very small chance of spawning Gunsmith or Drug tools (1%). 
    - White stashes will almost always spawn extra ammo crafting materials.
    - Stashes spawn in same map or directly connected maps, but not in connected of connected maps like it used to do. 
    - Stash item tiers have been adjusted for all maps. Map specific items tiers are now separated for Toolkits spawns vs Regular items spawns.
    - North maps regular item tiers have been more evenly spread through the 5 different tiers to ensure stashes being filed and to increase the item diversity spawning in north stashes.
    - Artefacts Melter has a chance to spawn in Green Stashes.
    - Green stashes are guaranteed every 8 tasks rewarding stashes.
- Recipes: Exo repair kit recipe is now a drop only item and cannot be bought from Mechanics. Legends and Master stalkers can drop it.
- The North Progression is now locked behind deactivating the Miracle Machine: North Psi field bypasses actor psi res and kills you in 3 hits.
- Clear Sky questline rewards: machine yard quest rewards a gunsmith kit now.
- No more starting knife with bugged durability, but the actor starts with Tier 2 knife, which should make melee more rewarding early on (you still need to upgrade it to field dress strong mutants).
- Sid doesn't scam you for medications to compensate for the lack of medic in Cordon, but has a slimer selection and amount of meds. 
- Fast Travel changes thanks to Fair Fast Travel addon:
    - Backpacks fast travel does not allow overweight, 
    - You must use the new and more expensive Guide Fast Travel Feature (available on right click) to fast travel while being overweighted. 
    - Fast travel to debug spots is now disabled. 
    - Fast travel is not time limited anymore but is generally more expensive and scales better with distance (meaning close fast travel are cheap but long fast travel are much more expensive).
- Starting Loadouts changes:
    - Rebalanced available Pistols, with NATO factions having the best available pistols.
    - Made PP2000 available to Duty and Monolith as a starting SMG.


**Gameplay**
- North repopulation:
    - A lot of the North spawns were locked behind story progression. These preconditions has been removed so the maps should be much more busy.
    - A lot of empty smart terrains have been repopulated.
    - North areas should be much less empty as respawn timers has been reduced.
    - North areas are *much more* dangerous than before. Be aware that Sin and ISG are now common enemies in the North. The mutants are also much stronger. Expect potential packs of controllers.
    - North bases should be much more busy with more tasks to do.
    - Jumper Giants are enabled should thus spawn north.
    - Very rarely, Sin has Rocket Launcher

- Radar and Brain Scorcher rework:
    - The Radar map has a bit more Monolith stalkers.
    - The Brain Scorcher lab is now *guarded when entering the map*. This means you will have to fight Monolithans *during the timer*.
    - Brain Scorcher guards tier has been reduced (easier enemies).
    - Brain Scorcher timer has been increased.

- South maps mutants populations rework:
    - Hopefully Meadows should spawn more diverse mutants more often.
    - Wild Territory mutants has been made more "urban": more snorks, less pigs.
    - Truck Cemetary should now be the "juicy south map": extremely dangerous but highly lucrative.
    - Rostok should spawn much less mutants.

- Psi System Rework:
    - New feedback upon receiving psi damages: the vision gets blurred and you hear your heartbeat during 0.40 seconds (very fast).
    - Psi damages and defense handler remade to be inline with the other fixed elemental defenses: much more consistent and more balanced.
    - Negative Psi resistances of artefacts do not nuke your psi defense anymore: it's additive like any other fixed elemental resistance.
    - Psi damages scale with difficulty and are overall a bit less strong.
    - There's no magical "psi res immunity threshold": you'll always take psi damages (max res is capped at 99% damage reduction).
    - Boosted psi res of drugs to match the new system (+20% psi res for the psy block).
    - Psi res consummables restore psi health much faster than before. Basically psi attacks will be harder to mitigate than before but psi consumables will help you much more. This should reduce the strict dependency of artefacts for psi related stuff. However there's a likeliness that some stuff simply one shots you if you don't have any psi res (unprotected controllers tube attack).
    - Fixed artefact and consummabels psi res display.
    - Artefacts do not regen psy health over time anymore (or very very little).
    - Faster phantoms.
    - Psi damages don't affect limb health.

- Meat mutants rebalance:
    - A bit less meat spawns on mutants.
    - More toxic uncooked and low tier cooked meats. This should promote the cooking of higher tier mutant meats.

- Artefacts spawning logic remade: 
    - Artefacts now tend to spawn faster in the map the actor is currently is, but the spawn chance is much more random. This means the artefacts spawning is still about the same as before but it's much less predictable and when entering a map the player should feel much less that all the anomalous fields are empty.

- Tasks rebalance
    - Lots of Dynamic tasks changes.
    - North factions rewards (Freedom...) are higher than south factions rewards (Duty, Loners...).
    - Rewards increased for fetch tasks requiring items with a condition by removing the cubed condition scaling, i.e. for a 70% condition item, the rewarded price is 0.70*price instead of the previous 0.70*0.70*0.70*price (one more Misery left over nuked, yaaaaay). This should affect artefacts fetch tasks *a lot*.
    - Artefacts fetch tasks reward multiplier increased.
    - Bounty Hunting tasks only target enemies in the same map or in connected maps only (no more Cordon rookie asking to kill a Monolith squad in Outskirts).
    - Increased medical items fetch task diversity.
    - Weapons Fetch tasks fixed > this should be bugless now and the asked guns should work.
    - Increased Rostok tasks delay > quests should be a bitless repeatable there.
    - Reduced Rostok Missions money rewards > no more 6k RU for checkpoint guards killing dogs.
    - Lukash Barrier Defense task does not reward ammo anymore.
    - Taskboard doesn't pull tasks from companions.

- New Tasks
    - New dynamic task asking for Drug Kit or Ammo Kit for all factions
    - Replaced Wolf buggy rescue stalker task by a new task asking to clear all the mutants from Cordon.
    - New Sakharov Task: clean mutants in Agroprom Udg.
    - New Sakharov Task: clean mutants in X16 Lab. Ecologists also now have a chance to spawn in x16 after the lab is done to make the map more lively.
    - Replaced Skinflint task for Bear Detectors for a new one asking for gear to infiltrate Duty. This is locked behind 1000 Goodwill with Freedom.
    - New dynamic task available for all Freedom to bring some drugs
    - New Fanatic Task to clear mutant nest in Meadow

- More dynamic faction relation to reduce the hobo murder player behavior (think before shooting):
    - Killing allies reduces reputation by 300 and the goodwill with the neutral victim faction by 140.
    - Killing enemies reduce enemies faction goodwill by 10.
    - Both these system take into account your "current" faction. Meaning you can still disguise as a Merc to kill Loners if you are a Loner to not suffer from the 140 goodwill penalty. However you'll still suffer from a -10 goodwill penalty.
    - Completing dynamic tasks for one faction decreases goodwill for enemy factions. Obvious tasks are affected only (killing others, giving guns, etc). 

- Improved AI responsiveness thanks to Dead Air devs and xcvb
    - NPCs are much more reactive when being shot at or shot around: they will try to seek a cover compared to where they think they got shot from.
    - NPCs should see the actor from farther away once alerted.
    - Monolith should see the actor from even farther away compared to other NPCs.
    - Once a NPC got it by a bullet shot from the actor, the whole squad associated to the victim should be alerted and try to seek the actor.

- Teivaz's Exo Item Use Animations ported to Anomaly for medkits, injectors, defense boosters and glucose shots. This essentially makes exos able to use important healing items much faster.

- Once a body is looted by an NPC, it stays looted independently of the NPCs fate. 

- Wepl hit effects fixes and reduced aim punch


**Gunplay**
- Increased base aim shake especially with scopes. Sniping should be a bit harder.

- Guns should be able to very very rarely jam/misfire at high condition.

- Ammo balances:
    - All ammo now have a bit more air resistance and should thus drop a bit more with the distance.
    - Subsonic rounds have been made significantly slower and drop more: flatness upgrades are thus important for 9x39 and 12.7x55.
    - Slugs are also slower and less efficient at range and should drop a bit more (23x75 and 12ga).
    - Sniper rounds damages have been reduced a little bit.
    - .45 ACP damage increased to 27 and AP increased to 20.
    - .45 Hydro is easier to crafte and a bit cheaper to buy.
    - 12ga buck and slugs are a bit more expensive.
    - 12ga buckshot is a bit harder to craft (everyone was buying them anyways).
    - 5.7 SS195 rounds AP increased to 22.

- New NPCs Armor System:
    - NPCs armor is now defined according to 3 body parts / groups of limns: head armor (head and neck), upper armor (body and arms) and lower armor (legs).
    - Each bullet decreases the armor value of one group based on the bullet Armor Penetration Power.
    - Once a body part armor is defeated, full damages are dealt to the NPCs.
    - Concussion damages (when ammo didn't penetrate the armor) have been slightly increased and made a bit more random.
    - Concussion damages for HP rounds have been reduced to match their FMJ counter part.
    - Concussion damages of Slugs and Buckshots have been reduced. Slugs still stagger in the head, thus making headshot spam still easy.
    - Slightly reduced damages to NPCs extremities
    - Removed the melee hit redirection to torso: aim for the head! Axes dunk is thus much more powerful.

- Guns balance:
    - Saigas mag size increase
    - Reduced endgame 5.45 guns recoil
    - Reduced AKM Alfa recoil significantly
    - Reduced AKM ISG recoil a little bit
    - Reduced AK104 Alfa recoil a little bit
    - Replaced AK104 by AK103 (grenade launcher compatible).
    - Firebreath Spas12 Salvo suppressor instead of NATO
    - PP2000 - mags have 45 rounds
    - PP2000 - 600rpm as IRL
    - PP2000 - now has high accuracy
    - Vihr reduced recoil, it's now a very strong 9x39 gun.
    - HOWA20 and RU556 normal 5.56 damages


**Balance**
- Easier bandits, tankier Sin, ISG and Monolith
- Slightly increased end game NPCs head armor to actor levels
- ISG teleporting should now avoid the bullet (bullet dodge system).
- Reduced exo outfit and exo helmet drop chance to match new north population.
- Some Scopes were moved at higher Trader Supply Level

- Vihr and SVU increased spawn chance on NPCs
- SVU repair type to advanced
- bit rarer SVD
- More common basic P90
- Bit more rare RPK16
- More rare Nosorog and Spartan Helm armor spawn chance
- Rebalanced Exo PSUs: No regen, but lower consumptions and higher storage capacities.
- Multiplied artefacts explosition resistance by 1.5 
- Heavy armors artefacts slots increased (Skat9, Exosuits) to make them more interesting to use.
- Reduced Drug kit and ammo kit prices.
